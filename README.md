Food is essential for human life and has been the concern of many healthcare conventions. Nowadays new dietary assessment and nutrition analysis tools enable more opportunities to help people understand their daily eating habits, exploring nutrition patterns and maintain a healthy diet. Nutritional analysis is the process of determining the nutritional content of food. It is a vital part of analytical chemistry that provides information about the chemical composition, processing, quality control and contamination of food. 
The main aim of the project is to build a model which is used for classifying the fruit depending on the different characteristics like colour, shape, texture etc. Here the user can capture the image of different fruits and then the image will be sent to the trained model. The model analyses the image and detects the nutrition based on the fruit (like Sugar, Fibre, Protein, Calories, etc.).
